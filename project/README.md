In this blinky buzzy toy I had several buttons perform different features to
mimic a device that would be similar to a toy.

SW1:

The first switch when pressed once activates the first state and switches the
color from red or green. It also uses the wdInterrupt to play through a song (Megalovania)
on its own after one press.

SW2:

The second switch when pressed is simply to change the colors of the LEDS from
red or green.

SW3:

The third switch when pressed will dim whatever light is currently on by
activating the P1 resistor as well as the P2 resistor depending on which light
is on.

SW4:

The last switch needs to be held down but plays a song like the first one
(tetris) and will switch the lights very rapidly to the tune of the song from
red to green.
